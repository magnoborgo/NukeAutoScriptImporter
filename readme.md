This action will help you quickly import .nk scripts from a folder into your current project

This script will load all .nk files into the current open project.
Use it to import shapes from Silhouette Roto and Paint, Trackers exported from matchmoving softwares and etc

The ideia is to place .nk files in a temporary folder and get rid of them after importing (deleting them automatically)
